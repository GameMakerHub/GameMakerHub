# About GameMakerHub
The idea for GameMakerHub is to have a centralized, open-source, community-driven place where developers can share work and learn regarding YoYoGames' Game Maker products. Please note that this community is not affiliated to YoYoGames in any way.

A few projects that will be part of GameMakerHub:

- A tool that mainly is a dependency manager, but in general helps you speed up your work (https://github.com/GameMakerHub/Catalyst)
- A centralized package repository (https://github.com/GameMakerHub/repository)
- Rules and suggestions for coding standards, to make collaboration easier (https://github.com/GameMakerHub/GameMakerStandards)
- A bunch of packages that will be available inside the dependency management tool
- Automation tools (Testing, building, deployments, integrations etc.)
- Example projects

There's also a Discord server you can join: https://discord.gg/zEue3AM
